      <section>
        Welcome! My name is Anis Gonzalez, I am a current employee at Amazon, I work full-time and am furthering my education as well. I am taking advantage of the benefits Amazon has to offer with a goal to start my career in the developing world. I created this site not only to showcase my developing skills but display who I am as well.

      <p style="font-weight:bold">Journey to Becoming a Developer</p>

      <article>
        I am starting out my journey to becoming a web developer with the help of Amazon and Correlation One. So far I have learned HTML from the basics to advanced tools. I have dabbled into coding before, so a lot was a review for me but the most interesting thing that I learned so far was how to make a web page accessible for users with different types of disabilities so everyone can enjoy the contents of a web page. I am creating this web page so everyone who comes across it, is able to see my progress in development with Correlation One. I will also be logging my skills on my LinkedIn

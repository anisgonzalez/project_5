<h1>Learn more about me</h1>
<p><span style="color:red;">I made a shift into the developer career, once covid happening.</span> before then I was going to school at San Jose State Univesity studying Chemical Engineerig. I continued taking course via online format but when classes resumed in person i did not have the funds to go back to the bay area. I stayed back home where it was not financially stressfull for me and changed my major to computer science. I took a few course at a community college but really never dedicated my full attention to my studys.<strong> I am hoping with Correlation One I can have a quicker start into the workforce with Software Development.</strong>
